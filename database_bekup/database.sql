There are also features like face unlock, OTG and notification light. The ROM is 16 GB and the MicroSD slot can be extended up to 64 GB. These features give this phone a strong stand in the low-budget scene. You may argue that it doesnâ€™t support 4G network and there are a few devices with 4G support around this price. So, it is a huge drawback for mobile internet users. It is indeed in some sense. However, the operating system is Android 9 Pie Go Edition, which makes the phone faster than a 3G phone with a regular Android version. 4G is still a much faster solution, but the internet speed may not be the biggest concern for many users anyway.

The FWVGA+ screen helps to get longer battery backup, but quality wise, HD+ screen would have been a much more appreciated feature.

High graphics game like PUBG can be played with low settings in this smartphone.\r\n\r\nSymphony i97 comes with a highly demanding fingerprint sensor at an attractive price. It also supports 4G. The battery is a decent 3200 mAh one. 5.7 inches HD+ IPS full-view screen is among the better ones around the price. The mysterious kind of gradient backside makes this phone more desirable.

If outlook plays a major role for you, this device can be a worthy choice for its cost.\r\nOne of the major features of Symphony Z15 is its 4000 mAh huge battery. It should easily provide one and a half day backup to regular users. A full charge may take about two and a half hour as there is no fast charging for this big battery. HD+ display quality should be crisp enough for pleasurable viewing experience. The fingerprint sensor responds in less than a second according to Symphony. There is also a software-based face unlock feature.\r\nAndroid Pie v9.0, 2 GB RAM and 1.6 GHz octa-core CPU is there to provide overall smooth performance for everyday usage. Light apps, internet browsing, using the camera should be fast and lag free.\r\n\r\nThe 13+2 MP back camera is impressive for the price. It can capture good quality daylight photos and there is also LED flash and night mode.

The design stands out quite well in the crowd. The display is big, rounded shape, logo placement etc. gives a very individualistic and elegant first impression. It comes with all the necessary features you may expect from a low-mid range device.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant advantages of Nokia 3.2 is its battery. The gadget comes with a 4000 mAh battery with 10W fast charging facility. Additionally, the phone is powered by Qualcommâ€™s Snapdragon 429 chipset, which is quite power efficient. On top of that, the device runs on Android One out of the box. It makes the phone even more power efficient. One can easily go for two days with one single charge. Android 9 Pie based on Android One is one of the most attractive features of Nokia 3.2. Usually, you wonâ€™t get Android One phones around this price range. For those who donâ€™t know, Android One makes gives a very simplistic, fast and clean user interface. It also provides much faster Android updates.\r\n\r\nThere is 3 GB RAM but the device runs on a Quad-core processor. So, you wonâ€™t get top-notch performance. It is still pretty neat and smooth for everyday usage. It is surely not the best gaming phone in the market, considering the price. But it certainly beats many of its competitors. Also, if longevity is important to you when it comes to performance, this is one of the better choices.\r\n\r\nThere is a single 13 MP back camera and 5 MP front camera which may sound disappointing to many. Especially because most phones around the cost are coming with dual or even triple rear camera setup. 5 MP front camera also seems pretty inferior. But one shouldnâ€™t forget that the name is still Nokia. So, it canâ€™t be a total disappointment. Nokiaâ€™s software optimization speaks for itself. Even with lower megapixels and simple setup, it should deliver impressive shots.\r\n\r\nFingerprint sensor, FM radio, biometric face unlock, 32 GB internal storage are some of its other essential features. Overall, Nokia 3.2 is a recommended phone from us. But you should always check out the phone by yourself and compare with other devices before finalizing your decision.','13,499','10'),('Mobile','Nokia','PT-000033','Nokia 4.2','  Nokia 4.2 is a low-mid range budget smartphone with Android One experience.

There are not too many phones with this exclusive feature. Phones like Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite also comes with Android One around this price range.\r\n\r\nNokia 4.2 has a glass back, which is something rare for the cost. Most phones are coming with a plain polycarbonate body. So, it is a good advantage. Also, the smaller 5.71 inches display with waterdrop notch makes this device compact and comfortable to hold for one hand usage. It is an excellent choice for everyday tasks such as making calls, fast internet browsing, using chat apps, watching videos and so on. The placement of the logo on the front and on the back looks quite elegant. The HD+ display with 295 PPI is also decent for the price','13,999','10'),('Mobile','Nokia','PT-000034','Nokia 2.2','  There are a few exciting facts about Nokia 2.2. First of all, it is the officially lowest priced Android One powered smartphone in Bangladesh as of July 2019. The 2 GB RAM version costs only 10,999 Tk. The chipset is a MediaTek Helio A22 and the CPU is quad-core which makes this phone unfit for bigger games such as PUBG. However, smaller games can be run quite smoothly also with the support of fairly decent PowerVR GE8320 GPU. Light apps usage and day to day multitasking should be ok for long-term. The 3 GB version for 12,999 TK. wouldnâ€™t make a big difference in terms of gaming as the chipset and CPU stay the same and there is also no fingerprint sensor. So, we suggest to go for the 2 GB version if 10,999 Tk. is your maximum budget. If you want to run games like PUBG more smoothly, want fingerprint sensor and better camera, Xiaomi Redmi 7 (3 GB version) is a good choice. Vivo Y93 or Nokia 4.2 are some other choices. Oppo A5s or Samsung Galaxy M20 are some more superior choices for a slightly higher price. But letâ€™s stick with Nokia 2.2 for now.','12,999','6'),('Mobile','Huawei','PT-000035','Huawei Nova 5T','  Huawei Nova 5T comes with 6.26 inches Full HD+ IPS screen.

It captures very good amount of lights and details considering the price factor.\r\nThe triple back camera is coming with different features. One of them is 120Â° ultra-wide mode to capture more of the ambient and expanded perspective of the environment. Daylight shots are overall natural looking, clear and the color reproduction is good.\r\nThe 3340 mAh battery is coming with Huawei QuickCharge which can fully charge the device in 1 hours and 45 minutes (approximately & when not in use). There is also USB Type-C for easier handing.\r\n6 GB RAM is combined with Huaweiâ€™s own 12 nm Kirin 710 chipset and up to 2.2 GHz octa-core CPU to ensure long-term efficiency, smoothness and stability regarding performance.\r\nMost smartphones come with an external MicroSD slot, but users prefer higher built-in storage that adding an extra memory card. P30 Liteâ€™s 128 GB ROM gives the opportunity to store a lot more media files and data than a 64 GB solution which is usually the case around this price range.\r\n ','25,999','10'),('Mobile','Huawei','PT-000037','Huawei Y Max','  7-inch tabs are still available in the market.

On top of that, the waterdrop notch design with greatly optimized screen to body ratio may allow users to use this device with one hand. However, it is still a pretty big device and we advise to practically hold it in the hand before purchasing if one hand usage is important. The display quality is Full HD+ and it is coming with an eye-care feature that protects the eyesight from harmful blue light which is found in most mobile devices of today.

Huawei Y5 2019 is the first phone in our experience with a much smaller 5.71 inches display. 5.71â€³ isnâ€™t that small by any mean. But because of the screen to body ratio and rounded shapes the device looks very compact, light and one of a kind. The faux or artificial leather back adds more uniqueness to the gadget. Some fine positives of this kind of material are comfortable grip, fingerprint and dirt resistance. However, we strongly recommend cleaning the back side often to protect the faux leather from absorbing and storing sweat and dirt.\r\nOne of the admirable facts of the newer Huawei smartphones is that they come with eye-care or eye-comfort displays. It means that the screen doesnâ€™t send harmful blue light to the viewers which can strongly damage the eyesight. Generally, we want to advise smartphone users not to look to the screen for a long period without taking any brakes, especially at night or dark conditions. Huawei is providing some relief in this case through their TÃœV Rheinland Certification of the eye-care screen. HD+ resolution is also a benefit for those who want to enjoy up to the standard viewing experience.\r\n13 MP back camera and 5 MP front camera should capture decent shots and are a reasonable deal for the price.\r\n3020 mAh battery is nothing over the top.
